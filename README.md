## How to Run

Nevergreen runs on port 5000 (by default).

```
lein run
```

## Config

The port is configured as an environment variable named `PORT`. This is defaulted to 5000.
Under *nix operating systems you can use the `export` command and under Windows the `set` command to easily set this value in a start up script.

When the application starts using a web browser navigate to `http://localhost:PORT`. This will check if the cctray url and a list of included projects has been set. If either have not been set it will redirect you to `http://localhost:PORT/config.html` here you are able to enter the cctray url and select the projects to show on the monitor. Once you have done this if you navigate back to `http://localhost:PORT` you will see your lovely monitor in action.

## Heroku deployment
