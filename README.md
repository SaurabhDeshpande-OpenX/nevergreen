# build-monitor-clj [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cowley05/build-monitor-clj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cowley05/build-monitor-clj)

A Clojure application designed to run an interesting build monitor.

It uses the *cctray.xml* format which is supported by nearly all CI servers. (I'm looking at you Bamboo) you can find each xml file under for each of the following ci servers under the following:


* GO - http://servername:8154/go/cctray.xml
* CruiseControl.rb - http://cc.rb.servername:3333/XmlStatusReport.aspx
* CruiseControl - http://cc.java.servername:8080/cctray.xml
* CruiseControl.NET - http://cc.net.servername/XmlStatusReport.aspx
* Jenkins - http://jenkins.servername:8080/cc.xml
* Hudson - http://hudson.servername:8080/cc.xml
* Travis CI - http://travis-ci.org/ownername/repositoryname/cc.xml
* tddium - - http://api.tddium.com/cc/long_uuid_string/cctray.xml

See a demo at http://build-monitor-clj.herokuapp.com

you can use https://builds.apache.org/cc.xml as a test cctray xml

## How to Run

The build monitor runs on port 5000 (by default).

```
lein ring server
```

# Config

The port is configured as an environment variable named `PORT`. This is defaulted to 5000.
Under *nix operating systems you can use the `export` command and under Windows the `set` command to easily set this value in a start up script.

When the application starts using a web browser navigate to `http://localhost:PORT`. This will check if the cctray url and a list of included projects has been set. If either have not been set it will redirect you to `http://localhost:PORT/config.html` here you are able to enter the cctray url and select the projects to show on the monitor. Once you have done this if you navigate back to `http://localhost:PORT` you will see your lovely monitor in action.

# Heroku deployment
