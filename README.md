# build-monitor-clj [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cowley05/build-monitor-clj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cowley05/build-monitor-clj)

A Clojure application designed to run an interesting build monitor.

It uses the *cctray.xml* format which is supported by nearly all CI servers. (I'm looking at you Bamboo)

See a demo at http://build-monitor-clj.herokuapp.com

## How to Run

The build monitor runs on port 5000.

```
export CCTRAY_URL=https://builds.apache.org/cc.xml
export INCLUDED_PROJECTS=".*"
lein ring server
```
