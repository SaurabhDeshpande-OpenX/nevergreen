Run locally
===========

You need to run three commands locally to get automatic updates for your changes

```
npm run building
npm run testing
lein ring server-headless
```

Once you are ready, run the ```pre-push.sh``` which mimics what the CI server will build.

How to add your own page
========================

TODO: Add sample.html to make it easy for new people to create a customized page.

Releases
=========

Alphabetically using the [Crayola colours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors), but not any green variations naturally!
